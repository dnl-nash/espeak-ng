#Intonation affects the rise and fall of the voice	
# The settings are 1 default, 2 less intonation, 3 even less intonation and commas do not raise the pitch, 4 the pitch rises at the end of a sentence rather than falling.
#The next line is a setting you can change.
intonation 3 3
# Setting the pitch range.  The first number gives a base pitch to the voice (value in Hertz).  The second number controls the range of pitches used by the voice. Setting it equal
# to the first number will give a monotone sounding voice.  The default values are 82 and 118.
pitch 135 110
# Tone: To apply an e.q. component to this voice, use a pair of numbers, first the frequency, than the volume.
# You can put as many pairs as you'd like, but all numbers must be positive.
